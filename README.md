# Local Library

## Use Case:
<p>You are building a web application for a local library. The library wants to create an online catalog of their books, and they want to be able to search for books by title, author, and subject. They also want to be able to add new books to the catalog, update existing book information, and delete books from the catalog.</p>

## Problem:
<ul><li>Create a web application that allows users to search for books by title, author, and subject</li>
<li>Allow users to add new books to the catalog</li>
<li>Allow users to update existing book information</li>
<li>Allow users to delete books from the catalog</li>
<li>Use MongoDB to store the book catalog data</li>
<li>Use PyMongo to interact with the MongoDB database from Python</li>
<li>Use Streamlit to build the user interface for the web application</li></ul>

## Solution:
<ol><li>Create a MongoDB database and collection to store the book catalog data</li>
<li>Use PyMongo to connect to the MongoDB database and perform CRUD operations on the book catalog data</li>
<li>Use Streamlit to build the user interface for the web application</li>
<li>Create a search form that allows users to search for books by title, author, and subject</li>
<li>Create forms that allow users to add new books to the catalog, update existing book information, and delete books from the catalog</li>
<li>Use PyMongo to query the MongoDB database and retrieve the search results</li>
<li>Use Streamlit to display the search results and the forms for adding, updating, and deleting books</li></ol>
